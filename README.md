### PROJECT SCOPE

- User can enter ingredients that they have and want to cook with or a specific dish they want to make. (The ui will on the left side for user)
- Our chatbot will return with recipes related to the user's queries, with their images.
- User can click on one of the recipes, making it expand and take the entire screen, and showing the entire recipe including all it's steps.

### Stuff to implement

- make the UI better for RecipeDetails
- use the prepTime and servings from the json
- add bookmark list for recipes, allowing to bookmark a recipe
- add local caching for saving recipes to bookmark
- make it so that it doesn't clear the recipes, but instead creates a new page on the right side, and you can go back on the left to view the previous page.


- Deploy on vercel
- Login / Auth (kinde)
- Connect to a postgres DB for chat history across devices (Neon)
