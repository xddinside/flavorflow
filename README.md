### PROJECT SCOPE

- User can enter ingredients that they have and want to cook with or a specific dish they want to make. (The ui will on the left side for user)
- Our chatbot will return with recipes related to the user's queries, with their images.
- User can click on one of the recipes, making it expand and take the entire screen, and showing the entire recipe including all it's steps.

### Test Prompts

I have some rice, lentils, and classic indian masala, ginger. I also have bread, cheese, butter and sauces like ketchup, mayonnaise, and chipotle sauce. what should i make for dinner, something that'd be filling?

### Stuff to implement

- Make it scroll on both sides left and right to the latest message streamed.
- On the response, respond always with 3 recipes. 
- show only the recipe name and the image and maybe a line or two explaining the dish.
- on clicking the recipe name or the image, expand that recipe to fullscreen and show the entire recipe including all the steps.
- improve the prompts suggested.
- make the UI better, add more color (amber)
- make the responses look cleaner and intuitive
